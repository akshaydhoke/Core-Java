1) Smallest subarray with sum greater than x

Given a number x and an array of integers arr, find the smallest subarray with sum greater than the given value. If such a subarray do not exist return 0 in that case.

Examples:

Input: x = 51, arr[] = [1, 4, 45, 6, 0, 19]
Output: 3
Explanation: Minimum length subarray is [4, 45, 6]

Input: x = 100, arr[] = [1, 10, 5, 2, 7]
Output: 0
Explanation: No subarray exist

2) Find the median

Given an array arr[] of integers, calculate the median.
NOTE: Return the floor value of the median

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [90, 100, 78, 89, 67]
Output: 89
Explanation: After sorting the array middle element is the median 

Input: arr[] = [56, 67, 30, 79]
Output: 61
Explanation: In case of even number of elements, average of two middle elements is the median. 

Input: arr[] = [1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The average of both elements will result in 1.
